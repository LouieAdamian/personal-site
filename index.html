    <p class="bio">I am a student at NuVu Studio, amateur marine biologist, and an avid computer engineer. At NuVu I work on a range of different projects in electrical, computer science, mechanical engineering, design, and media. I have always loved building things since I was a little kid and computers fascinated me because of their complexity, as a child I thought they were magic. I started programming in 6th grade I started with Java in Processing making basic 2d video games then moved to working with C++ in Arduino making little robots and embedded devices.</p>

    <p class="bio">At NuVu studio I have done a large range of computer science and engineering projects I started at NuVu in the summer of 2015 before my freshman year. I was somewhat overambitious 14-year-old. I worked on a walking robot that moves toward objects that were the temperature of humans, and a fixed-wing drone that used PID tuning, GPS and ultrasonic distance sensors to self-navigate. I have always been ambitious, and I enjoy pushing myself, finding my limits and working to create the most advanced product I am capable of. Sense my freshman summer at NuVu I have worked on a diverse range of projects I created a basic artificial intelligence for driving around miniature cars. I worked on a tandem bike called the Groundbreaking Bike on which the rear pedals propelled the bike and powered a set of bellows that's front set of pedals drove a mechanism that shoveled dirt for the groundbreaking of DivcoWest's Cambridge Crossing development. Helping people with disabilities is important to me so I created a Device called the <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/open-innovation-fall-2018/flex-o-skeleton#tab-portfolio">Flexoskeleton</a>, a flexible exoskeleton integrated into a sleeve that helps a man with muscle spasticity in his bicep move by sensing the electrical impulses in his triceps and pulling his arm open with cables attached to motors on the sleeve.</p>
    <p class="bio">When I am not working on projects at NuVu I love scuba diving and marine biology. At SeaTrek BVI I have learned to scuba dive and found my love of marine biology. My first year I got my NAUI scuba diver, advanced diver, Underwater Naturalist, and Digital Image Diver. The second year I got my Nitrox Diver, and Scientific Driver. I also did a project on the health of Acropora Palmata and Acropora Civercornis after the hurricane. </p>
